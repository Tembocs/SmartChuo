# SmartChuo

SmartChuo is an integrated college management system designed to simplify and unify institutional operations. It brings together essential modules for student information, teaching and non-teaching staff records, asset management, and guest house administration. The goal is to provide colleges with a single platform that improves efficiency, transparency, and accessibility for both staff and students.

This is the initial version of SmartChuo, starting with a modular architecture that will evolve over time. Each module will be developed with scalability in mind, allowing future integration with cloud services and mobile applications. The system aims to support both offline and online workflows, making it suitable for institutions with diverse infrastructure setups.
